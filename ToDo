1. Make jenkins public for connection from github X
    1.1 Need to find out why using cloudflared to connect to reverse proxy (nginx-ingress) isnt working. Using LB service currently instead
    Behavior: Always redirect to internal hostname, need to check Proxy Forward headers for more information

2. Check k8s self-signed cert
3. Add logout section to application
4. Integrate new features to homepage, as much as possible
5. Read document if having time enough (learning how k8s authenticate user)
