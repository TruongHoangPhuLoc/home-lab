NGINX Ingress Controller works with both NGINX and NGINX Plus and supports the standard Ingress features - content-based
routing and TLS/SSL termination.

Additionally, several NGINX and NGINX Plus features are available as extensions to the Ingress resource via annotations
and the ConfigMap resource. In addition to HTTP, NGINX Ingress Controller supports load balancing Websocket, gRPC, TCP
and UDP applications. See
[ConfigMap](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/configuration/global-configuration/configmap-resource/) and
[Annotations](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/configuration/ingress-resources/advanced-configuration-with-annotations/)
docs to learn more about the supported features and customization options.

As an alternative to the Ingress, NGINX Ingress Controller supports the VirtualServer and VirtualServerRoute resources.
They enable use cases not supported with the Ingress resource, such as traffic splitting and advanced content-based
routing. See [VirtualServer and VirtualServerRoute resources
doc](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/configuration/virtualserver-and-virtualserverroute-resources/).

TCP, UDP and TLS Passthrough load balancing is also supported. See the [TransportServer resource
doc](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/configuration/transportserver-resource/).

Read [this doc](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/intro/nginx-plus) to learn more about NGINX Ingress
Controller with NGINX Plus.

> **Note**
>
> This project is different from the NGINX Ingress Controller in
[kubernetes/ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx) repo. See [this
doc](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/intro/nginx-ingress-controllers) to find out about the key
differences.

## Ingress and Ingress Controller

### What is the Ingress?

The Ingress is a Kubernetes resource that lets you configure an HTTP load balancer for applications running on
Kubernetes, represented by one or more [Services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/).
Such a load balancer is necessary to deliver those applications to clients outside of the Kubernetes cluster.

The Ingress resource supports the following features:

- **Content-based routing**:
  - *Host-based routing*. For example, routing requests with the host header `foo.example.com` to one group of services
  and the host header `bar.example.com` to another group.
  - *Path-based routing*. For example, routing requests with the URI that starts with `/serviceA` to service A and
  requests with the URI that starts with `/serviceB` to service B.
- **TLS/SSL termination** for each hostname, such as `foo.example.com`.

See the [Ingress User Guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) to learn more about the
Ingress resource.

### What is the Ingress Controller?

The Ingress Controller is an application that runs in a cluster and configures an HTTP load balancer according to
Ingress resources. The load balancer can be a software load balancer running in the cluster or a hardware or cloud load
balancer running externally. Different load balancers require different Ingress Controller implementations.

In the case of NGINX, the Ingress Controller is deployed in a pod along with the load balancer.

## Getting Started

> **Note**
>
> All documentation should only be used with the latest stable release, indicated on [the releases
> page](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/releases) of the GitHub repository.

1. Install the NGINX Ingress Controller using the [Helm
   chart](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/installation/installing-nic/installation-with-helm/) or the Kubernetes
   [manifests](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/installation/installing-nic/installation-with-manifests/).
1. Configure load balancing for a simple web application:
    - Use the Ingress resource. See the [Cafe
      example](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/tree/main/examples/ingress-resources/complete-example).
    - Or the VirtualServer resource. See the [Basic
      configuration](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/tree/main/examples/custom-resources/basic-configuration)
      example.
1. See additional configuration [examples](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/tree/main/examples).
1. Learn more about all available configuration and customization in the
   [docs](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/).

## NGINX Ingress Controller Releases

We publish NGINX Ingress Controller releases on GitHub. See our [releases
page](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/releases).

The latest stable release is [3.5.0](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/releases/tag/v3.5.0). For production
use, we recommend that you choose the latest stable release.

The edge version is useful for experimenting with new features that are not yet published in a stable release. To use
it, choose the *edge* version built from the [latest
commit](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/commits/main) from the main branch.

To use the NGINX Ingress Controller, you need to have access to:

- An NGINX Ingress Controller image.
- Installation manifests or a Helm chart.
- Documentation and examples.

It is important that the versions of those things above match.

The table below summarizes the options regarding the images, Helm chart, manifests, documentation and examples and gives
your links to the correct versions:

| Version | Description |  Image for NGINX | Image for NGINX Plus | Installation Manifests and Helm Chart | Documentation and Examples |
| ------- | ----------- | --------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------| -------------------------- |
| Latest stable release | For production use | Use the 3.5.0 images from [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/nginx/nginx-ingress/), [GitHub Container](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pkgs/container/kubernetes-ingress), [Amazon ECR Public Gallery](https://gallery.ecr.aws/nginx/nginx-ingress) or [Quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/nginx/nginx-ingress) or [build your own image](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/installation/building-ingress-controller-image/). | Use the 3.5.0 images from the [F5 Container Registry](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/installation/pulling-ingress-controller-image/) or the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/search/?CREATOR=741df81b-dfdc-4d36-b8da-945ea66b522c&FULFILLMENT_OPTION_TYPE=CONTAINER&filters=CREATOR%2CFULFILLMENT_OPTION_TYPE) or [Build your own image](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/installation/building-nginx-ingress-controller/). | [Manifests](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/tree/v3.5.0/deployments).

## SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)

We generate SBOMs for the binaries and the Docker images.

### Binaries

The SBOMs for the binaries are available in the releases page. The SBOMs are generated using
[syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft) and are available in SPDX format.

### Docker Images

The SBOMs for the Docker images are available in the [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/nginx/nginx-ingress/), [GitHub
Container](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pkgs/container/kubernetes-ingress), [Amazon ECR Public
Gallery](https://gallery.ecr.aws/nginx/nginx-ingress) or [Quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/nginx/nginx-ingress)
repositories. The SBOMs are generated using [syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft) and stored as an attestation in the
image manifest.

For example to retrieve the SBOM for `linux/amd64` from Docker Hub and analyze it using
[grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype) you can run the following command:

```console
docker buildx imagetools inspect nginx/nginx-ingress:edge --format '{{ json (index .SBOM "linux/amd64").SPDX }}' | grype
```
