You have two options for deploying NGINX Ingress Controller:

- **Deployment**. Choose this method for the flexibility to dynamically change the number of NGINX Ingress Controller replicas.
- **DaemonSet**. Choose this method if you want NGINX Ingress Controller to run on all nodes or a subset of nodes.

Before you start, update the [command-line arguments]({{< relref "configuration/global-configuration/command-line-arguments.md" >}}) for the NGINX Ingress Controller container in the relevant manifest file to meet your specific requirements.
