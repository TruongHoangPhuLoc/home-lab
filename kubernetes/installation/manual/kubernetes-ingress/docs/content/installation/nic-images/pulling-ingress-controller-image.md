## Before you begin

Before you start, you'll need these installed on your machine:

- [Docker v18.09 or higher](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/18.09/).
- An NGINX Ingress Controller subscription. Download both the certificate (*nginx-repo.crt*) and key (*nginx-repo.key*) from the [MyF5 Customer Portal](https://my.f5.com). Keep in mind that an NGINX Plus certificate and key won't work for for the steps in this guide.

---

## Set up Docker for F5 Container Registry

Start by setting up Docker to communicate with the F5 Container Registry located at `private-registry.nginx.com`. If you're using Linux, follow these steps to create a directory and add your certificate and key:

```shell
mkdir -p /etc/docker/certs.d/private-registry.nginx.com
cp <path-to-your-nginx-repo.crt> /etc/docker/certs.d/private-registry.nginx.com/client.cert
cp <path-to-your-nginx-repo.key> /etc/docker/certs.d/private-registry.nginx.com/client.key
```

The steps provided are for Linux. For Mac or Windows, consult the [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#add-client-certificates) or [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#how-do-i-add-client-certificates) documentation. For more details on Docker Engine security, you can refer to the [Docker Engine Security documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/).

## Pull the image

Next, pull the image you need from `private-registry.nginx.com`. To find the correct image, consult the [Tech Specs guide]({{< relref "technical-specifications#images-with-nginx-plus" >}}).

To pull an image, follow these steps. Replace `<version-tag>` with the specific version you need, for example, `3.5.0`.

- For NGINX Plus Ingress Controller, run:

  ```shell
  docker pull private-registry.nginx.com/nginx-ic/nginx-plus-ingress:<version-tag>
  ```

- For NGINX Plus Ingress Controller with NGINX App Protect WAF, run:

   ```shell
   docker pull private-registry.nginx.com/nginx-ic-nap/nginx-plus-ingress:<version-tag>
   ```

- For NGINX Plus Ingress Controller with NGINX App Protect DoS, run:

   ```shell
   docker pull private-registry.nginx.com/nginx-ic-dos/nginx-plus-ingress:<version-tag>
   ```

You can use the Docker registry API to list the available image tags by running the following commands. Replace `<path-to-client.key>` with the location of your client key and `<path-to-client.cert>` with the location of your client certificate. The `jq` command is used to format the JSON output for easier reading.

```json
$ curl https://private-registry.nginx.com/v2/nginx-ic/nginx-plus-ingress/tags/list --key <path-to-client.key> --cert <path-to-client.cert> | jq
{
  "name": "nginx-ic/nginx-plus-ingress",
  "tags": [
    "3.5.0-alpine",
    "3.5.0-alpine-fips",
    "3.5.0-ubi",
    "3.5.0"
  ]
}

$ curl https://private-registry.nginx.com/v2/nginx-ic-nap/nginx-plus-ingress/tags/list --key <path-to-client.key> --cert <path-to-client.cert> | jq
{
  "name": "nginx-ic-nap/nginx-plus-ingress",
  "tags": [
    "3.5.0-alpine-fips",
    "3.5.0-ubi",
    "3.5.0"
  ]
}

$ curl https://private-registry.nginx.com/v2/nginx-ic-dos/nginx-plus-ingress/tags/list --key <path-to-client.key> --cert <path-to-client.cert> | jq
{
  "name": "nginx-ic-dos/nginx-plus-ingress",
  "tags": [
    "3.5.0-ubi",
    "3.5.0"
  ]
}
```

## Push to your private registry

After pulling the image, tag it and upload it to your private registry.

1. Log in to your private registry:

   ```shell
   docker login <my-docker-registry>
   ```

1. Tag and push the image. Replace `<my-docker-registry>` with your registry's path and `<version-tag>` with the version you're using, for example `3.5.0`:

   - For NGINX Plus Ingress Controller, run:

      ```shell
      docker tag private-registry.nginx.com/nginx-ic/nginx-plus-ingress:<version-tag> <my-docker-registry>/nginx-ic/nginx-plus-ingress:<version-tag>
      docker push <my-docker-registry>/nginx-ic/nginx-plus-ingress:<version-tag>
      ```

   - For NGINX Controller with NGINX App Protect WAF, run:

      ```shell
      docker tag private-registry.nginx.com/nginx-ic-nap/nginx-plus-ingress:<version-tag> <my-docker-registry>/nginx-ic-nap/nginx-plus-ingress:<version-tag>
      docker push <my-docker-registry>/nginx-ic-nap/nginx-plus-ingress:<version-tag>
      ```

   - For NGINX Controller with NGINX App Protect DoS, run:

      ```shell
      docker tag private-registry.nginx.com/nginx-ic-dos/nginx-plus-ingress:<version-tag> <my-docker-registry>/nginx-ic-dos/nginx-plus-ingress:<version-tag>
      docker push <my-docker-registry>/nginx-ic-dos/nginx-plus-ingress:<version-tag>
      ```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while following this guide, here are solutions to common problems:

- **Certificate errors**
  - **Likely Cause**: Incorrect certificate or key location, or using an NGINX Plus certificate.
  - **Solution**: Verify you have the correct NGINX Ingress Controller certificate and key. Place them in the correct directory and ensure the certificate has a *.cert* extension.

- **Docker version compatibility**
  - **Likely Cause**: Outdated Docker version.
  - **Solution**: Make sure you're running [Docker v18.09 or higher](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/18.09/). Upgrade if necessary.

- **Can't pull the image**
  - **Likely Cause**: Mismatched image name or tag.
  - **Solution**: Double-check the image name and tag against the [Tech Specs guide]({{< relref "technical-specifications.md#images-with-nginx-plus" >}}).

- **Failed to push to private registry**
  - **Likely Cause**: Not logged into your private registry or incorrect image tagging.
  - **Solution**: Verify login status and correct image tagging before pushing. Consult the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/repos/) for more details.

## Alternative installation options

You can also get the NGINX Ingress Controller image using the following alternate methods:

- [Install using a JWT token in a Docker Config Secret]({{< relref "using-the-jwt-token-docker-secret" >}}).
- [Build the Ingress Controller image]({{< relref "building-nginx-ingress-controller" >}}) using the source code from the GitHub repository and your NGINX Plus subscription certificate and key.
- For NGINX Ingress Controller based on NGINX OSS, you can pull the [nginx/nginx-ingress image](https://hub.docker.com/r/nginx/nginx-ingress/) from DockerHub.
