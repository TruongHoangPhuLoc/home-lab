We will provide technical support for NGINX Ingress Controller on any Kubernetes platform that is currently supported by
its provider and that passes the Kubernetes conformance tests. This release was fully tested on the following Kubernetes
versions: 1.23-1.29.

## 3.4.0

19 Dec 2023

The default_server listeners for ports 80 and 443 can now be fully customized giving you the flexibility to shift the HTTP and HTTPS default listeners to other ports as your needs require.

Traffic splits now support weights from 0 - 100 giving you the control that you expect when performing canary roll outs of your back end services.

A new capability of "upstream backup" has been introduced for NGINX Plus customers. This gives you the control to set a backup service for any path. This takes advantage of NGINX health checks and will automatically forward traffic to the backup service when all pods of the primary service stop responding.

Dynamic reloading of SSL certificates takes advantage of native NGINX functionality to dynamically load updated certificates when they are requested and thus not require a reload when certificates update.

A number of Helm enhancements have come directly from our community and range from giving greater flexibility for HPA, namespace sharing for custom sidecars, and supporting multiple image pull secrets for greater deployment flexibility.

To make sure the NGINX Ingress Controller follows Helm best practices, we've refactored our helm chart location. You can now find our helm charts under `charts\nginx-ingress`.

We’ve added the functionality to define App Protect WAF bundles for VirtualServers by creating policy bundles and putting them on a mounted volume accessible from NGINX Ingress Controller.

## 3.3.0

26 Sep 2023

### <i class="fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass"></i> Overview

With release 3.3 the NGINX Ingress Controller continues to advance capabilities for an ever-demanding set of use cases
that go beyond simple layer 7 routing for services running exclusively in Kubernetes.

When involved in diagnostic operations and viewing the NGINX Plus console or when viewing the enhanced NGINX Plus
metrics through Prometheus, customers now enjoy the added dimension of the backend service being available to aide in
identification of issues as well as observing performance.

50% of our users continue to rely heavily on the Ingress resource and its "mergeable Ingress" usage pattern, to enhance
the experience for these customers we have added the path-regex annotation with support for case sensitive, case
insensitive, as well as exact regex match patterns.

Prometheus continues to be the most popular metrics platform for Kubernetes users. To further enhance ease of setting up
integration with Prometheus we have finalized support for the Prometheus serviceMonitor capability. Providing better
scraping controls for Prometheus admins.

For our most demanding customers performing a blue / green upgrade of the Ingress Controller itself supports the ability
to provide their business customers an enhanced experience with no loss of session fidelity. Support for this pattern
and others has been added through Helm chart enhancement that allows two deployments to share a single ingressClass
resource and duplicate the same configuration.

To accommodate these enhancements, several new values have been added to our Helm chart, as well as modifications to
existing values. Due to the potential impacts of these changes we have issued a major release to the Helm chart,
advancing to v1.0.0

To better align with the demands of supporting additional protocols such as MQTT and QUIC, the NGINX Ingress Controller
is changing how listeners are defined for HTTP traffic. You have always had controls over the ports defined for
TCP/UDP traffic through the GlobalConfiguration and TransportServer objects. That same flexibility has been introduced
for HTTP/S traffic and the VirtualServer. This area will continue to expand to give customers full control over NGINX
listeners so they can tailor to their specific needs and policies.

<hr>

## 3.1.1

04 May 2023

### <i class="fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass"></i> Overview

This release reverts the changes made in 3.1.0 to use sysctls to bind to lower level ports without the NET_BIND_SERVICE capability. It also adds support for serviceNameOverride in the Helm chart, that can be used to override the service name for the NGINX Ingress Controller. This is useful especially during an upgrade from versions prior to 3.1.0, to avoid downtime due to the service name change. To use this feature, set the `serviceNameOverride` value in the Helm chart to the name of the existing service.

For example, if the existing service name is `my-release-nginx-ingress`, you can use `--set serviceNameOverride=my-release-nginx-ingress` when running the upgrade command.
Here is an example upgrade command that keeps the existing service name `my-release-nginx-ingress` for a deployment named `my-release`:

```console
helm upgrade my-release oci://ghcr.io/nginxinc/charts/nginx-ingress --version 0.17.1 --set serviceNameOverride=my-release-nginx-ingress
```

## 3.1.0

29 Mar 2023

### <i class="fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass"></i> Overview

- Beginning with release 3.1.0 the NET_BIND_SERVICE capability is no longer used, and instead relies on net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start sysctl to allow port binding. Kubernetes 1.22 or later is required for this sysctl to be [classified as safe](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/sysctl-cluster/#safe-and-unsafe-sysctls). **Ensure that you are using the latest updated `deployment` and `daemonset` example yaml files available in the repo.**
- *The minimum supported version of Kubernetes is now 1.22*. The NGINX Ingress Controller now uses `sysctls` to [bind to lower level ports without additional privileges](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/3573/). This removes the need to use `NET_BIND_SERVICE` to bind to these ports. Thanks to [Valters Jansons](https://github.com/sigv) for making this feature possible!
- Added support for loading pre-compiled [AppProtect Policy Bundles](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/3560) when using the `-enable-app-protect` cli argument. This feature removes the need for the Ingress Controller to compile NGINX App Protect Policy when NGINX App Protect Policy is updated.
- IngressMTLS policy now supports configuring a Certificate Revocation Lists(CRL). When using this feature requests made using a revoked certificate will be rejected. See [Using a Certificate Revocation List](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/configuration/policy-resource/#using-a-certificate-revocation-list) for details on configuring this option.
- The NGINX Ingress Controller now supports [running with a Read-only Root Filesystem](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/3548). This improves the security posture of NGINX Ingress Controller by protecting the file system from unknown writes. See [Configure root filesystem as read-only](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/configuration/security/#configure-root-filesystem-as-read-only) for details on configuring this option with both HELM and Manifest. Thanks to [Valters Jansons](https://github.com/sigv) for making this feature possible!
- HELM deployments can now set [custom environment variables with controller.env](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/3326). Thanks to [Aaron Shiels](https://github.com/AaronShiels) for making this possible!
- HELM deployments can now configure a [pod disruption budget](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/3248) allowing deployments to configure either a minimum number or a maximum unavailable number of pods. Thanks to [Bryan Hendryx](https://github.com/coolbry95) for making this possible!
- The NGINX Ingress Controller uses the latest OIDC reference implementation which now supports [forwarding access tokens to upstreams / backends](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/3474). Thanks to [Shawn Kim](https://github.com/shawnhankim) for making this possible!
- The default TLS secret is now optional. This improves the security posture of NGINX Ingress Controller through enabling [ssl_reject_handshake](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_ssl_module.html#ssl_reject_handshake). This has the impact of immediately terminating the SSL handshake and not revealing TLS or cypher settings to calls that do not match a configured hostname.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-rocket"></i> Features

## 2.4.0

04 October 2022

### <i class="fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass"></i> Overview

- Added support for enabling [proxy_protocol](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/tree/v2.4.0/examples/shared-examples/proxy-protocol) when port 443 is being used for both HTTPS traffic and [TLS Passthrough traffic](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/tree/v2.4.0/examples/custom-resources/tls-passthrough).
- Updates to the TransportServer resource to support using [ExternalName services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#externalname). For examples, see [externalname-services](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/tree/v2.4.0/examples/custom-resources/externalname-services).
- VirtualServer resource now supports [wildcard hostname](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#hostname-wildcards).
- NGINX Ingress Controller images including the combined NGINX AppProtect WAF and NGINX AppProtect DoS solutions are now published to our registry. See [Images with NGINX Plus](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/technical-specifications/#images-with-nginx-plus) for a detailed list of images in our registry.
- Added support for watching multiple namespaces using the [-watch-namespace](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/configuration/global-configuration/command-line-arguments/#-watch-namespace-string) cli argument. This can configured by passing a comma-separated list of namespaces to the `-watch-namespace` CLI argument (e.g. `-watch-namespace=ns-1,ns-2`).
- A new cli argument has been added: [-include-year](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/configuration/global-configuration/command-line-arguments/#-include-year). This appends the current year to the log output from the Ingress Controller. Example output: `I20220512 09:20:42.345457`.
- Post-startup configuration reloads have been optimized to reduce traffic impacts. When many resources are modified at the same time, changes are combined to reduce the number of data plane reloads.

## 2.3.0

12 July 2022

### <i class="fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass"></i> Overview

- Support making VirtualServer resources discoverable via public DNS servers using [external-dns](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/external-dns). Examples for configuring external-dns with NGINX Ingress Controller can be found [here](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/tree/v2.3.0/examples/custom-resources/external-dns).
- Resolves [CVE-2022-30535](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K52125139). This vulnerability impacted the visibility of secrets accessible by NGINX Ingress Controller. In some cases, secrets visible to NGINX Ingress Controller could be exposed to any authenticated user with permission to create and update Ingress objects. This vulnerability affected Ingress objects only - our Custom Resources (VirtualServer and TransportServer) were not affected. Customers unable to upgrade should migrate any Ingress resources to VirtualServer resources where possible, and use RBAC to restrict write access for users for Ingress objects.
- Support using HTTP basic authentication with [VirtualServer](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/tree/v2.3.1/examples/custom-resources/basic-auth) and [Ingress](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/tree/v2.3.0/examples/basic-auth) resources. Special thanks to [Simon Wachter](https://github.com/svvac).

- Full support for IPv6 using the NGINX Ingress Controller [VirtualServer and VirtualServerRoute](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/configuration/virtualserver-and-virtualserverroute-resources) custom resources, and Ingress resources.

- The [-enable-preview-policies](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/configuration/global-configuration/command-line-arguments/#-enable-preview-policies) cli argument has been deprecated and is no longer required for the usage of any Policy resource type. This argument will be removed completely in v2.6.0.

- A new [-enable-oidc](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/configuration/global-configuration/command-line-arguments/#-enable-oidc) cli argument has been added to enable OIDC policies. Previously, this behaviour was achieved through the usage of the `-enable-preview-policies` cli argument.

## 2.1.0

06 January 2022

### <i class="fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass"></i> Overview

- Support for NGINX App Protect Denial of Service protection with NGINX Ingress Controller. More information about [NGINX App Protect DoS](https://www.nginx.com/products/nginx-app-protect/denial-of-service/). Examples for configuring NGINX App Protect DoS with NGINX Ingress Controller can be found [here](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/tree/v2.1.1/examples/appprotect-dos).

- Full support for gRPC services using the NGINX Ingress Controller [VirtualServer and VirtualServerRoute](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/configuration/virtualserver-and-virtualserverroute-resources) custom resource definitions.  This makes configuring and supporting gRPC services much easier, giving a simple YAML configuration and removing the need for snippets. Resource definition examples for gRPC can be found [here](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/tree/v2.1.1/examples/custom-resources/grpc-upstreams).

- Implementation of NGINX mandatory and persistent health checks in VirtualServer and VirtualServerRoute to further reduce interruptions to your service traffic as configuration changes continuously happen in your dynamic Kubernetes environment(s). Health checks have been extended to include `mandatory` and `persistent` fields. Mandatory health checks ensures that a new upstream server starts receiving traffic only after the health check passes. Mandatory health checks can be marked as persistent, so that the previous state is remembered when the Ingress Controller reloads NGINX Plus configuration. When combined with the slow-start parameter, the mandatory health check give a new upstream server more time to connect to databases and “warm up” before being asked to handle their full share of traffic. See the settings [here](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/configuration/virtualserver-and-virtualserverroute-resources/#upstreamhealthcheck). More about the [NGINX Plus mandatory and persistent health check features](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/load-balancer/http-health-check/#mandatory-health-checks).

## 2.0.0

28 September 2021

### <i class="fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass"></i> Overview

Release 2.0.0 includes:

- *Support for Ingress networking.k8s.io/v1*. Kubernetes 1.22 removes support for networking.k8s.io/v1beta1. To support Kubernetes 1.22, NGINX Ingress Controller 2.0 is also compatible with only the networking.k8s.io/v1 version of the Ingress and IngressClass resources.  This has the following implications:
  1. The minimum supported version of Kubernetes is now 1.19. For older Kubernetes versions, use the 1.12.x release of the Ingress Controller.
  2. For Kubernetes versions 1.19-1.21, you can continue using the `networking.k8s.io/v1beta1` of the Ingress and IngressClass resources.
  3. For Kubernetes 1.22, you need to migrate your Ingress and IngressClass resources to `networking.k8s.io/v1`.
  4. If you are using the deprecated `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` annotation in your Ingress resources, it is recommended to switch to the `ingressClassName` field.

     We migrated all our documentation and examples to use `networking.k8s.io/v1` and the `ingressClassName` field of the Ingress resource.
- *Scalability improvements*. We improved the time for an Ingress Controller pod to become ready and start receiving traffic. This is especially noticeable when you have hundreds of Ingress or other configuration resources like VirtualServers: instead of several minutes or more in rare cases, a pod will become ready within a few minutes.
- *Documentation improvements* We changed the look and feel of our documentation at <https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller> as well as the underlying publishing technology, which will allow us to bring even more improvements in the next releases.
- *Upgrade path for k8s.nginx.org/v1alpha1 Policy resource* If you’re running release 1.9.0 and using the k8s.nginx.org/v1alpha1 Policy, the Ingress Controller now supports an upgrade path from v1alpha1 to v1 Policy version without downtime. See UPDATING POLICIES section below.

You will find the complete changelog for release 2.0.0, including bug fixes, improvements, and changes below.

See the complete list of supported images for NGINX and NGINX Plus on the [Technical Specifications](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/technical-specifications/#supported-docker-images) page.

INCREASED UPSTREAM ZONES

We increased the default size of an upstream zone from 256K to 512K to accommodate a change in NGINX Plus R25. The change makes NGINX Plus allocate more memory for storing upstream server (peer) data, which means upstream server zones will use more memory to account for that new data.

The increase in the zone size is to prevent NGINX Plus configuration reload failures after an upgrade to release 1.13.0. Note that If a zone becomes full, NGINX Plus will fail to reload and fail to add more upstream servers via the API.

The new 512K default value will be able to hold ~270 upstream servers per upstream, similarly to how the old 256K value was able to hold the same number of upstream servers in the previous Ingress Controller releases. You can understand the utilization of the upstream zones via [NGINX Plus API](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_api_module.html#slabs) and the [NGINX Plus dashboard](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/logging-and-monitoring/status-page/#accessing-live-activity-monitoring-dashboard) (the shared zones tab).

If you have a large number of upstream in the NGINX Plus configuration of the Ingress Controller, expect that after an upgrade NGINX Plus will consume more memory: +256K per upstream. If you don’t have upstreams with huge number of upstream serves and you’d like to reduce the memory usage of NGINX Plus, you can configure the `upstream-zone-size` [ConfigMap key](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/configuration/global-configuration/configmap-resource/#backend-services-upstreams) with a lower value. Additionally, the Ingress resource supports `nginx.org/upstream-zone-size` [annotation](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/configuration/ingress-resources/advanced-configuration-with-annotations/#backend-services-upstreams) to configure zone sizes for the upstreams of an Ingress resource rather than globally.

UPDATING POLICIES

This section is only relevant if you’re running release 1.9.0 and planning to upgrade to release 2.0.0.

Release 1.10 removed the `k8s.nginx.org/v1alpha1 version` of the Policy resource and introduced the `k8s.nginx.org/v1` version. This means that to upgrade to release 1.10 users had to re-create v1alpha1 Policies with the v1 version, which caused downtime for their applications. Release 2.0.0 brings back the support for the v1alpha1 Policy, which makes it possible to upgrade from 1.9.0 to 2.0.0 release without causing downtime:

- If the Policy is marked as a preview feature in the [documentation](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/configuration/policy-resource/), make sure the -enable-preview-policies command-line argument is set in 2.0.0 Ingress Controller.
- During the upgrade, the existing Policies will not be removed.
- After the upgrade, make sure to update the Policy manifests to k8s.nginx.org/v1 version.

Please also read the [release 1.10 changelog](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/releases/#nginx-ingress-controller-1100) for the instructions on how to update Secret resources, which is also necessary since some of the Policies reference Secrets.

Note that 2.1.0 will remove support for the v1alpha1 version of the Policy.

Previously, to handle missing or invalid TLS Secrets in Ingress and VirtualServer resources, the Ingress Controller would configure NGINX to break any attempts for clients to establish TLS connections to the affected hosts using `ssl_ciphers NULL;` in the NGINX configuration. The method didn't work for TLS v1.3. Now the Ingress Controller uses `ssl_reject_handshake on;`, which works for TLS v1.3.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-bug"></i> Known Issues

- [1448](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/issues/1448) When an Ingress Controller pod starts, it can report warnings about missing secrets for Ingress and other resources that reference secrets. Those warnings are intermittent - once the Ingress Controller fully processes the resources of the cluster, it will clear the warnings. Only after that, the Ingress Controller will become ready to accept client traffic - its readiness probe will succeed.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-download"></i> Upgrade

- For NGINX, use the 1.11.0 image from our DockerHub: `nginx/nginx-ingress:1.11.0`, `nginx/nginx-ingress:1.11.0-alpine` or `nginx-ingress:1.11.0-ubi`
- For NGINX Plus, please build your own image using the 1.11.0 source code.
- For Helm, use version 0.9.0 of the chart.
- [1241](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1241) improved the Makefile. As a result, the commands for building the Ingress Controller image were changed. See the updated commands [here](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/installation/building-ingress-controller-image/#building-the-image-and-pushing-it-to-the-private-registry).
- [1241](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1241) also consolidated all Dockerfiles into a single Dockerfile. If you customized any of the Dockerfiles, make sure to port the changes to the new Dockerfile.
- [1288](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1288) further improved validation of Ingress annotations. See this [document](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/configuration/ingress-resources/advanced-configuration-with-annotations/#validation) to learn more about which annotations are validated. Note that the Ingress Controller will reject resources with invalid annotations, which means clients will see `404` responses from NGINX.  Before upgrading, ensure the Ingress resources don't have annotations with invalid values. Otherwise, after the upgrade, the Ingress Controller will reject such resources.
- [1457](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1457) fixed the bug when an Ingress Controller pod could become ready before it generated the configuration for all relevant resources in the cluster. The fix also requires that the Ingress Controller can successfully list the relevant resources from the Kubernetes API. For example, if the `-enable-custom-resources` cli argument is `true` (which is the default), the VirtualServer, VirtualServerRoute, TransportServer, and Policy CRDs must be created in the cluster, so that the Ingress Controller can list them. This is similar to other custom resources -- see the list [here](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/installation/installation-with-manifests/#create-custom-resources). Thus, before upgrading, make sure that the CRDs are created in the cluster. Otherwise, the Ingress Controller pods will not become ready.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-download"></i> Upgrade

- For NGINX, use the 1.10.0 image from our DockerHub: `nginx/nginx-ingress:1.10.0`, `nginx/nginx-ingress:1.10.0-alpine` or `nginx-ingress:1.10.0-ubi`
- For NGINX Plus, please build your own image using the 1.10.0 source code.
- For Helm, use version 0.8.0 of the chart.
- As a result of [1270](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1270) and [1277](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1277), the Ingress Controller improved validation of Ingress annotations: more annotations are validated and validation errors are reported via events for Ingress resources. Additionally, the default behavior for invalid annotation values was changed: instead of using the default values, the Ingress Controller will reject a resource with an invalid annotation value, which will make clients see `404` responses from NGINX. See this [document](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/configuration/ingress-resources/advanced-configuration-with-annotations/#validation) to learn more. Before upgrading, ensure the Ingress resources don't have annotations with invalid values. Otherwise, after the upgrade, the Ingress Controller will reject such resources.
- In [1232](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1232) `controller.serviceAccount.imagePullSecrets` was removed. Use the new `controller.serviceAccount.imagePullSecretName` instead.
- The Policy resource was promoted to `v1`. If you used the `alpha1` version, the policies are needed to be recreated with the `v1` version. Before upgrading the Ingress Controller, run the following command to remove the `alpha1` policies CRD (that will also remove all existing `alpha1` policies):

    ```console
     kubectl delete crd policies.k8s.nginx.org
    ```

  As part of the upgrade, make sure to create the `v1` policies CRD. See the corresponding instructions for the [manifests](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/installation/installation-with-manifests/#create-custom-resources) and [Helm](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/installation/installation-with-helm/#upgrading-the-crds) installations.

  Also note that all policies except for `accessControl` are still in preview. To enable them, run the Ingress Controller with `- -enable-preview-policies` command-line argument (`controller.enablePreviewPolicies` Helm parameter).
- It is necessary to update secret resources. See the section UPDATING SECRETS below.

UPDATING SECRETS:

In [1225](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1225), as part of improving how the Ingress Controller handles secret resources, we added a requirement for secrets to be of one of the following types:

- `kubernetes.io/tls` for TLS secrets.
- `nginx.org/jwk` for JWK secrets.
- `nginx.org/ca` for CA secrets.

The Ingress Controller now ignores secrets that are not of a supported type. As a consequence, special upgrade steps are required.

Before upgrading, ensure that the secrets referenced in Ingress, VirtualServer or Policies resources are of a supported type, which is configured via the `type` field. Because that field is immutable, it is necessary to either:

- Recreate the secrets. Note that in this case, the client traffic for the affected resources will be rejected for the period during which a secret doesn't exist in the cluster.
- Create copies of the secrets and update the affected resources to reference the copies. The copies need to be of a supported type. In contrast with the previous options, this will not make NGINX reject the client traffic.

It is also necessary to update the default server secret and the wildcard secret (if it was configured) in case their type is not `kubernetes.io/tls`. The steps depend on how you installed the Ingress Controller: via manifests or Helm. Performing the steps will not lead to a disruption of the client traffic, as the Ingress Controller retains the default and wildcard secrets if they are removed.

For *manifests installation*:

1. Recreate the default server secret and the wildcard secret with the type `kubernetes.io/tls`.
1. Upgrade the Ingress Controller.

For *Helm installation*, there two cases:

1. If Helm created the secrets (you configured `controller.defaultTLS.cert` and `controller.defaultTLS.key` for the default secret and `controller.wildcardTLS.cert` and `controller.wildcardTLS.key` for the wildcard secret), then no special upgrade steps are required: during the upgrade, the Helm will remove the existing default and wildcard secrets and create new ones with different names with the type `kubernetes.io/tls`.
1. If you created the secrets separately from Helm (you configured `controller.defaultTLS.secret` for the default secret and `controller.wildcardTLS.secret` for the wildcard secret):
    1. Recreate the secrets with the type `kubernetes.io/tls`.
    1. Upgrade to the new Helm release.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-upload"></i> Dependencies

- [1182](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1182) Update NGINX version to 1.19.3.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-download"></i> Upgrade

- For NGINX, use the 1.9.0 image from our DockerHub: `nginx/nginx-ingress:1.9.0`, `nginx/nginx-ingress:1.9.0-alpine` or `nginx-ingress:1.9.0-ubi`
- For NGINX Plus, please build your own image using the 1.9.0 source code.
- For Helm, use version 0.7.0 of the chart.

For Kubernetes >= 1.18, when upgrading using the [manifests](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/installation/installation-with-manifests/), make sure to update the [ClusterRole](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/blob/v1.9.0/deployments/rbac/rbac.yaml) and create the [IngressClass resource](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/blob/v1.9.0/deployments/common/ingress-class.yaml), which is required for Kubernetes >= 1.18. Otherwise, the Ingress Controller will fail to start. If you run multiple NGINX Ingress Controllers in the cluster, each Ingress Controller must have its own IngressClass resource. As the `-use-ingress-class-only` argument is now ignored (see NOTES), make sure your Ingress resources have the `ingressClassName` field or the `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` annotation set to the name of the IngressClass resource. Otherwise, the Ingress Controller will ignore them.

#### Helm Upgrade

- If you're using custom resources like VirtualServer and TransportServer (`controller.enableCustomResources` is set to `true`), after you run the `helm upgrade` command, the CRDs will not be upgraded. After running the `helm upgrade` command, run `kubectl apply -f deployments/helm-chart/crds` to upgrade the CRDs.
- For Kubernetes >= 1.18, a dedicated IngressClass resource, which is configured by `controller.ingressClass`, is required per helm release. Ensure `controller.ingressClass` is not set to the name of the IngressClass of other releases or Ingress Controllers. As the `controller.useIngressClassOnly` parameter is now ignored (see NOTES), make sure your Ingress resources have the `ingressClassName` field or the `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` annotation set to the value of `controller.ingressClass`. Otherwise, the Ingress Controller will ignore them.

### Notes

- When using Kubernetes >= 1.18, the `-use-ingress-class-only` command-line argument is now ignored, and the Ingress Controller will only process resources that belong to its class. See [IngressClass doc](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/installation/running-multiple-ingress-controllers/#ingress-class) for more details.
- For Kubernetes >= 1.18, a dedicated IngressClass resource, which is configured by `controller.ingressClass`, is required per helm release. When upgrading or installing releases, ensure `controller.ingressClass` is not set to the name of the IngressClass of other releases or Ingress Controllers.

- [1029](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1029): Add readiness endpoint. The Ingress Controller now exposes a readiness endpoint on port `8081` and the path `/nginx-ready`. The endpoint returns a `200` response after the Ingress Controller finishes the initial configuration of NGINX at the start. The pod template was updated to use that endpoint in a readiness probe.
- [980](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/980): Enable leader election by default.
- Documentation improvements: [946](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/946) thanks to [谭九鼎](https://github.com/imba-tjd), [948](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/948), [972](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/972), [965](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/965).

- Add new parameters to the Chart: `controller.appprotect.enable`, `controller.globalConfiguration.create`, `controller.globalConfiguration.spec`, `controller.readyStatus.enable`, `controller.readyStatus.port`, `controller.config.annotations`, `controller.reportIngressStatus.annotations`. Added in  [1035](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1035), [1034](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1034), [1029](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1029), [1003](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1003) thanks to [RubyLangdon](https://github.com/RubyLangdon).
- [1047](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1047) and [1009](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1009): Change how Helm manages the custom resource definitions (CRDs) to support installing multiple Ingress Controller releases. **Note**: If you're using the custom resources (`controller.enableCustomResources` is set to `true`), this is a breaking change. See the HELM UPGRADE section below for the upgrade instructions.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-upload"></i> Dependencies

- Update NGINX version to 1.19.1.
- Update NGINX Plus to R22.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-download"></i> Upgrade

- For NGINX, use the 1.8.0 image from our DockerHub: `nginx/nginx-ingress:1.8.0`, `nginx/nginx-ingress:1.8.0-alpine` or `nginx-ingress:1.8.0-ubi`
- For NGINX Plus, please build your own image using the 1.8.0 source code.
- For Helm, use version 0.6.0 of the chart.

#### Helm Upgrade

If you're using custom resources like VirtualServer and TransportServer (`controller.enableCustomResources` is set to `true`), after you run the `helm upgrade` command, the CRDs and the corresponding custom resources will be removed from the cluster. Before upgrading, make sure to back up the custom resources. After running the `helm upgrade` command, run `kubectl apply -f deployments/helm-chart/crds` to re-install the CRDs and then restore the custom resources.

### Notes

- As part of installing a release, Helm will install the CRDs unless that step is disabled (see the [corresponding doc](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/installation/installation-with-helm/)). The installed CRDs include the CRDs for all Ingress Controller features, including the ones disabled by default (like App Protect with `aplogconfs.appprotect.f5.com` and `appolicies.appprotect.f5.com` CRDs).

#### Helm upgrade

If leader election (the `controller.reportIngressStatus.enableLeaderElection` parameter) is enabled, when upgrading to the new version of the Helm chart:

1. Make sure to specify a new ConfigMap lock name (`controller.reportIngressStatus.leaderElectionLockName`) different from the one that was created by the current version. To find out the current name, check ConfigMap resources in the namespace where the Ingress Controller is running.
1. After the upgrade, delete the old ConfigMap.

Otherwise, the helm upgrade will not succeed.
