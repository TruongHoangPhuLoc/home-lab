# Custom HTTP Listeners

In this example, we will configure a VirtualServer resource with custom HTTP listeners.
This will allow HTTP and/or HTTPs based requests to be made on non-default ports.

## Prerequisites

1. Follow the [installation](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/installation/installation-with-manifests/)
   instructions to deploy the Ingress Controller with custom resources enabled.
2. Ensure the Ingress Controller is configured with the `-global-configuration` argument:

   ```console
   args:
      - -global-configuration=$(POD_NAMESPACE)/nginx-configuration
   ```

3. Save the public IP address of the Ingress Controller into a shell variable:

   ```console
   IC_IP=XXX.YYY.ZZZ.III
   ```

4. If you have a NodePort or Loadbalancer service deployed, ensure they are updated to include the custom listener ports.
Example YAML for a LoadBalancer:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: nginx-ingress
     namespace: nginx-ingress
   spec:
     type: LoadBalancer
     ports:
     - port: 8083
       targetPort: 8083
       protocol: TCP
       name: http-8083
     - port: 8443
       targetPort: 8443
       protocol: TCP
       name: https-8443
     selector:
       app: nginx-ingress
   ```

## Step 1 - Deploy the GlobalConfiguration resource

Similar to how listeners are configured in our [basic-tcp-udp](../../examples/custom-resource/basic-tcp-udp) examples,
here we deploy a GlobalConfiguration resource with the listeners we want to use in our VirtualServer.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: k8s.nginx.org/v1alpha1
   kind: GlobalConfiguration
   metadata:
     name: nginx-configuration
     namespace: nginx-ingress
   spec:
     listeners:
     - name: http-8083
       port: 8083
       protocol: HTTP
     - name: https-8443
       port: 8443
       protocol: HTTP
       ssl: true
   ```

   ```console
   kubectl create -f global-configuration.yaml
   ```

## Step 2 - Save the custom port numbers

Save the custom HTTP and/or HTTPS ports into a shell variables for later:

   ```console
   IC_HTTP_PORT=8083
   IC_HTTPS_PORT=8443
   ```

## Step 3 - Deploy the Cafe Application

Create the coffee and the tea deployments and services:

   ```console
   kubectl create -f cafe.yaml
   ```

## Step 4 - Deploy the VirtualServer with custom listeners

The VirtualServer in this example is set to use the listeners defined in the GlobalConfiguration resource
that was deployed in Step 1. Below is the yaml of this example VirtualServer:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: k8s.nginx.org/v1
   kind: VirtualServer
   metadata:
     name: cafe
   spec:
     listener:
       http: http-8083
       https: https-8443
     host: cafe.example.com
     tls:
       secret: cafe-secret
     upstreams:
     - name: tea
       service: tea-svc
       port: 80
     - name: coffee
       service: coffee-svc
       port: 80
     routes:
     - path: /tea
       action:
         pass: tea
     - path: /coffee
       action:
         pass: coffee
   ```

1. Create the secret with the TLS certificate and key:

    ```console
    kubectl create -f cafe-secret.yaml
    ```

2. Create the VirtualServer resource:

    ```console
    kubectl create -f cafe-virtual-server.yaml
    ```

## Step 5 - Test the Configuration

1. Check that the configuration has been successfully applied by inspecting the events of the VirtualServer:

    ```console
    kubectl describe virtualserver cafe
    ```

   Below you will see the events as well as the new `Listeners` field

    ```console
   . . .
   Spec:
      Host:  cafe.example.com
      Listener:
         Http:   http-8083
         Https:  https-8443
   . . .
   Routes:
    . . .
    Events:
      Type    Reason          Age   From                      Message
      ----    ------          ----  ----                      -------
      Normal  AddedOrUpdated  7s    nginx-ingress-controller  Configuration for default/cafe was added or updated
    ```

2. Since the deployed VirtualServer is using ports `8083` and 8443` in this example. you must explicitly specify these ports
when sending requests to the endpoints of this VirtualServer:

    For `/coffee` on `8443`:

    ```console
    curl -k https://cafe.example.com:8443/coffee
    ```

    ```text
    Server address: 10.32.0.40:8080
    Server name: coffee-7dd75bc79b-qmhmv
    ...
    URI: /coffee
    ...
    ```

    For `/coffee` on `8083`:

    ```console
    curl -k https://cafe.example.com:8083/coffee
    ```

    ```text
    Server address: 10.32.0.40:8080
    Server name: coffee-7dd75bc79b-qmhmv
    ...
    URI: /coffee
    ...
    ```
